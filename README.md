# css-zen-garden
Testing your css skills to see how much can be done with css.
For this project I chose to work on CSS Zen Garden. I began by searching out fonts use 
I used @import to bring in a few Google fonts, 
I then wrote in some css resets in order to override the default margins,
and paddings and also a box-sizing and set it to border-box to avoid padding causing boxes to
spill out of their containers.
